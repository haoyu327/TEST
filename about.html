            <h1>Our Mission</h1>
            <p>Our mission is to transform farming into a service sector, making agriculture more profitable with
              reduced risk to the farmer, more environmentally friendly, and to produce cheaper, better and healthier
              food.<br> AutoHarvest has the ability to improve current farming practices in a variety of ways. Tasks
              requiring manual labour, such as strawberry picking, are made easier by reducing the need to find
              labourers. This is especially useful in areas struggling to find agricultural labour such as the USA and
              UK. In addition, Thorvald is small and lightweight compared with modern farming equipment. This means that
              Thorvald has a small impact on the environment and the quality of farmland due to a reduction in soil
              compaction.</p>

            <h1>Get to Know Us</h1>
            <p>The Thorvald platform emerged from the robotics group at the Norwegian University of Life Sciences. By
              working closely with farmers, the main challenges for producers, both in Norway and internationally, were
              identified; we saw the need to introduce robots to the agricultural domain for solving critical issues
              such as labour shortages, sustainability and yield security.<br>With this foundation, Saga Robotics was
              established as a company committed to delivering autonomous services for the agricultural industry. Saga
              Robotics combined a robust mechanical design with intelligent autonomy, and the world's leading
              agricultural platform, Thorvald, was born.</p>
